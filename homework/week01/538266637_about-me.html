        <p style="font-family:helvetica;">i'm from saugerties, new york, a small town about 3 hours southeast of hereâ€”the same town jimmy fallon grew up in. saugerties also borders the town of woodstock, which everyone familiarizes with the 1969 woodstock music festival. not everyone there is a hippy, but it does radiate happiness and good food. </p>
